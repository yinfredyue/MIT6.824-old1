2020/03/23 15:01:38 0 Becomes leader! 
2020/03/23 15:01:38 Server 0 (leader) started, index = 1, term = 1
2020/03/23 15:01:38 0 is leader, command submitted

Problem: 0 is taken as leader, but later step down due to leader 1. However, the
request is only send to 0 but not 1 any more.
Solution: change the start&end of periodicHeartbeatRoutine() to start sending
heartbeat immediately after becoming leader.
